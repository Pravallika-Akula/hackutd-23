Prompt: Understanding what it takes to purchase a home has always been challenging. The paperwork can be extremely confusing and dense, and it is hard to figure out if you have the necessary means to complete the purchase. What steps can you take to improve your ability to purchase a home?

In this challenge we are presenting you with a list of potential homebuyers and some relevant data for each of them. The goal of this challenge is two-fold.

Evaluate the potential homebuyer data and determine if they are ready to buy a home.
If they are not â€“ offer meaningful suggestions about steps that they can take to improve their position.
